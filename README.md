Virus Defense libGDX wrapped
==========================
This is more or Less [Virus Defense](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense) of July 19, 2014 (Commit 48058a3), wrapped with libGDX. That means it uses Slick2d in addition to libGDX.
I only tested the desktop Version and it seems to work the same with the same quirks and issues.
