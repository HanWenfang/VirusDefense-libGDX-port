Virus Defense libGDX wrapped
==========================
This is more or Less [Virus Defense](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense) of July 19, 2014 (Commit 48058a3), wrapped with libGDX. That means it uses Slick2d in addition to libGDX. 

The libGDX implementation is pased on a libGDX [Demo](https://github.com/badlogic/theplanethatcouldntflygood).

I only tested the desktop Version and it seems to work like the slick2d version, with the same quirks and issues. I did not manage to create a working jar file, i only tested it through eclipse.
